# Students' Council Page

# Inspiration
This project is inspired by the ASRJC official school website (www.asrjc.moe.edu.sg). This website is meant to serve as a site for Student Councillors in ASRJC to make use of, so that they are aware of what they have to do and what is next for them online. It is also meant to be a one-stop-shop for Student Councillors for ease of access to various information. As we have CCA twice a week, missing a CCA session might cause us to lack behind and it might be hard to know what is going on, so this website also helps us stay organised and updated.

# What it does
This website reminds us of our role and identity as a Student Councillor, clearly stating our objectives and responsibilities. It also helps us track our progress on the current work we have.

# How it’s built
The web app was built using an app.py file, a Python file with the main back-end code that serves as the backbone of the website. This is accompanied by '.html' files in the 'templates' folder to display the interface and make it user-friendly. Lastly, the 'statics' folder stores the 'style.css' file, which helps design the interface using colours, size adjustments and so on.

# Challenges encountered
One of the challenges I encountered was finding the error in my code. As my code can sometimes be lengthy and in large blocks, I realised the importance of staying organised and keeping my code succinct to avoid typos and bugs. Aside from that, I also faced the challenge of linking database and '.csv' files to my Python code, as it is something we have just learnt. However, through debugging, I was able to find out what went wrong and where to make changes in my code.

# Accomplishments that I’m proud of
I am proud that I managed to bring all the '.html' files and the Python file together. As it can be confusing at times trying to link all of them together to build a functioning web app, I am happy to say that by using the Python file as the main "trunk" of the "tree", and the various '.html' files as its "branches", I was able to connect them together and link all of them to one place, creating a functioning web app.

# What I learned
I learnt that building a web app is not an easy task. We should appreciate every detail -- no matter how big the 'app.py' Python file code is, or how small of a detail which a line of code in the 'style.css' file provides, it still took every coder some time to help craft the web app to what it is.

# What’s next for
The next steps for the website is to continue its functionality as a website for Student Councillors, and possibly create more features for us to use.
